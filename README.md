# Ice-Man-Game-Project
The Ice Man is a game set in an oil field where the ice man digs for oil barrels while dodging regular and hardcore protestors that chase and annoy him. The ice man can collect and use tools such as water for his squirt gun, gold nuggets to bribe protestors, boulders to bonk protesters, and sonar abilities to reveal goodies in the area.
